# VHDL 8-Bit Processor Design

## Introduction

Welcome to the VHDL 8-Bit Processor Design project! This repository contains the design and implementation details of an 8-bit processor, built using VHDL. The project includes various components such as the Control Unit, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), memory management, and communication interfaces.

The architecture supports fundamental operations and communication protocols, allowing for data manipulation and control signals specific to 8-bit processing. Additionally, a Python script is provided to convert assembly code into binary format, facilitating seamless uploads to external memory.

For a comprehensive understanding of the processor's logic, architecture, and operational flow, please refer to the detailed documentation provided in the PDF:
